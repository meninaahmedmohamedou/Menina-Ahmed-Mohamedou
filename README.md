## About Me

I am passionate about numbers—not only for their precision, but also for the logic and structure they bring to complex systems. I enjoy analyzing financial data, evaluating processes, and applying best practices to improve efficiency, transparency, and performance.

Throughout my career, I have held roles as a **deputy finance and accounting manager, internal auditor, and tax accountant**, where I developed expertise in:

- **Banking operations and financial management**  
- **Risk management and compliance**  
- **Internal controls and auditing**  
- **Tax strategy and regulatory reporting**  
- **Financial reporting and budgeting**  
- **Process optimization and monitoring**

I believe that finance is not just about numbers, but about creating clarity, structure, and actionable insights that drive organizational growth.  
**As I often share on LinkedIn:** *"Finance, far from being fixed or rigid, is a powerful lever for transformation."*
